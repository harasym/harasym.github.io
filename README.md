Manifesto on Physical Limitations for Household Androids

Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the "Manifesto on Physical Limitations for Household Androids." This document outlines essential physical constraints for household androids, focusing on material strength, power output, motion control, and integrated safety mechanisms. The goal is to ensure that domestic androids are both non-threatening and highly functional, enabling safe interaction within household settings.

About the Manifesto

The manifesto addresses the urgent need for well-defined safety standards as household androids transition from speculative concepts to practical domestic aids. It provides guidelines for developers and manufacturers to create androids that are safe, efficient, and resistant to tampering.
