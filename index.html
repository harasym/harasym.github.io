    <h1>Manifesto on Physical Limitations for Household Androids</h1>
    <p>The rapid convergence of robotics, language models, image recognition, and acoustic processing has accelerated the transition of household androids from speculative concepts to practical domestic aids. This accelerated technological progress points to a future where assistant and service androids become a familiar part of everyday life, thus creating an urgent need for well-defined safety standards that govern their physical and operational limits within the home.
</p>
    <p>This framework outlines essential physical constraints for household androids, focusing on material strength, power output, motion control, and integrated safety mechanisms. These guidelines aim to ensure that domestic androids are both non-threatening and highly functional, enabling safe interaction within household settings. By adopting these principles, developers and manufacturers commit to a system that not only fulfills basic safety needs but anticipates the ethical and practical demands of a rapidly evolving field. Each point highlights the importance of robust, hardware-focused constraints, thorough testing, and a commitment to user protection, ultimately safeguarding people, property, and the broader household environment.
</p>
    
    <h2>Core Principles</h2>
    <h3>1.1. Material Strength Limitations</h3>
    <p>Household androids should not be constructed from materials that provide extreme durability, which would make them excessively resistant to damage. Maintaining their destructibility is essential to prevent potential harm to humans in cases of malfunction or misuse. Materials should be chosen to support typical household wear-and-tear without providing undue resilience.
</p>
    
    <h3>1.2. Motor and Power Source Constraints</h3>
    <p>The power systems (including motors and energy sources) of androids must be limited to household-use levels. This constraint will prevent them from performing excessive physical exertion or handling loads beyond what is necessary for standard domestic tasks, ensuring they remain within safe operational boundaries.</p>
    
    <h3>1.3. Movement Speed and Amplitude Restriction</h3>
    <p>Androids should be mechanically limited to avoid large, rapid movements. While they may perform quick, small-amplitude tasks (e.g., wiping or writing), any large-amplitude motions should be executed at a slower pace to reduce the risk of injury. These restrictions must be enforced through mechanical design rather than software, ensuring that any mechanical breakdown leads to a full shutdown of the affected part rather than bypassing safety mechanisms.
</p>
    
    <h3>1.4. Self-Limiting Safety Mechanisms</h3>
    <p>Safety mechanisms must be integrated to engage fully in the event of a malfunction. For example, joints should lock to prevent movement if they experience a failure, rather than continuing uncontrolled motion. These self-limiting features should prevent any operation outside of the android’s safe capacity, maintaining security even in the case of partial breakdowns.</p>
    
    <h2>Detailed Breakdown of Core Principles</h2>
    <h3>2.1. Material Strength Limitations</h3>
    <p><section>
    <p>
        The choice of materials for household androids should prioritize safety by ensuring the robot remains 
        destructible under certain conditions and does not possess extreme durability or resilience. This constraint 
        minimizes the risks associated with misuse or malfunction, preventing androids from becoming physically 
        invulnerable to the user or external forces, which could lead to unintended safety hazards.
    </p>

    <h3>Purpose and Justification:</h3>

    <h4>Safety in Case of Malfunction</h4>
    <p>
        By using materials that are <strong>breakable or deformable</strong> under excessive stress, the android can naturally 
        limit its operational integrity if it begins to malfunction or move erratically. This destructibility acts as 
        a secondary safety layer, reducing the potential for harm to humans if the android operates unpredictably. 
        For instance, <em>brittle or easily deformed materials</em> ensure that, even in the worst-case scenario, the android 
        can be stopped or restrained by reasonable human action.
    </p>

    <h4>Reduction of Tampering and Misuse</h4>
    <p>
        Robust materials, often used in industrial or military-grade machines, are designed to withstand 
        substantial wear and impact. When applied to domestic androids, these materials can inadvertently enable 
        repurposing or tampering for higher-stress applications. By deliberately <strong>limiting material strength</strong> to 
        household standards, manufacturers can restrict the android’s potential for being used in unintended 
        and possibly dangerous ways. This strategy ensures that the android remains dedicated to its intended 
        environment, reducing liability and safety concerns.
    </p>

    <h4>Economic and Environmental Benefits</h4>
    <p>
        Domestic-grade materials are generally <strong>less costly and more sustainable</strong> than specialized, high-durability 
        alternatives. A household android made from destructible materials can contribute to a lower environmental 
        footprint, as the need for rare or industrial-strength materials is minimized. This cost-effectiveness 
        also lowers the barrier for consumers and manufacturers, making the android more accessible while adhering 
        to safety.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Implementing material strength limitations in household androids is a foundational safety measure. It ensures 
        that androids designed for domestic environments are not only <strong>safe and tamper-resistant</strong> but also 
        sustainable and economically viable, making this a valuable constraint in the development of responsible 
        robotics for everyday use.
