    <h1>Manifesto on Physical Limitations for Household Androids</h1>
    <p>The rapid convergence of robotics, language models, image recognition, and acoustic processing has accelerated the transition of household androids from speculative concepts to practical domestic aids. This accelerated technological progress points to a future where assistant and service androids become a familiar part of everyday life, thus creating an urgent need for well-defined safety standards that govern their physical and operational limits within the home.
</p>
    <p>This framework outlines essential physical constraints for household androids, focusing on material strength, power output, motion control, and integrated safety mechanisms. These guidelines aim to ensure that domestic androids are both non-threatening and highly functional, enabling safe interaction within household settings. By adopting these principles, developers and manufacturers commit to a system that not only fulfills basic safety needs but anticipates the ethical and practical demands of a rapidly evolving field. Each point highlights the importance of robust, hardware-focused constraints, thorough testing, and a commitment to user protection, ultimately safeguarding people, property, and the broader household environment.
</p>
    
    <h2>Core Principles</h2>
    <h3>1.1. Material Strength Limitations</h3>
    <p>Household androids should not be constructed from materials that provide extreme durability, which would make them excessively resistant to damage. Maintaining their destructibility is essential to prevent potential harm to humans in cases of malfunction or misuse. Materials should be chosen to support typical household wear-and-tear without providing undue resilience.
</p>
    
    <h3>1.2. Motor and Power Source Constraints</h3>
    <p>The power systems (including motors and energy sources) of androids must be limited to household-use levels. This constraint will prevent them from performing excessive physical exertion or handling loads beyond what is necessary for standard domestic tasks, ensuring they remain within safe operational boundaries.</p>
    
    <h3>1.3. Movement Speed and Amplitude Restriction</h3>
    <p>Androids should be mechanically limited to avoid large, rapid movements. While they may perform quick, small-amplitude tasks (e.g., wiping or writing), any large-amplitude motions should be executed at a slower pace to reduce the risk of injury. These restrictions must be enforced through mechanical design rather than software, ensuring that any mechanical breakdown leads to a full shutdown of the affected part rather than bypassing safety mechanisms.
</p>
    
    <h3>1.4. Self-Limiting Safety Mechanisms</h3>
    <p>Safety mechanisms must be integrated to engage fully in the event of a malfunction. For example, joints should lock to prevent movement if they experience a failure, rather than continuing uncontrolled motion. These self-limiting features should prevent any operation outside of the androidâ€™s safe capacity, maintaining security even in the case of partial breakdowns.</p>
