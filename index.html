    <h1>Manifesto on Physical Limitations for Household Androids</h1>
    <p>The rapid convergence of robotics, language models, image recognition, and acoustic processing has accelerated the transition of household androids...</p>
    
    <h2>Core Principles</h2>
    <h3>1.1. Material Strength Limitations</h3>
    <p>Household androids should not be constructed from materials that provide extreme durability...</p>
    
    <h3>1.2. Motor and Power Source Constraints</h3>
    <p>The power systems (including motors and energy sources) of androids must be limited to household-use levels...</p>
    
    <h3>1.3. Movement Speed and Amplitude Restriction</h3>
    <p>Androids should be mechanically limited to avoid large, rapid movements...</p>
    
    <h3>1.4. Self-Limiting Safety Mechanisms</h3>
    <p>Safety mechanisms must be integrated to engage fully in the event of a malfunction...</p>
    
    <h2>Detailed Breakdown of Core Principles</h2>
    <h3>2.1. Material Strength Limitations</h3>
    <p>The choice of materials for household androids should prioritize safety by ensuring the robot remains destructible...</p>
    
    <h3>2.2. Motor and Power Source Constraints</h3>
    <p>Household androids must be equipped with motors and power sources that are specifically limited to domestic-use capacities...</p>
    
    <h3>2.3. Movement Speed and Amplitude Restriction</h3>
    <p>To ensure safety within household environments, androids must have strict mechanical limitations...</p>
    
    <h3>2.4. Self-Limiting Safety Mechanisms</h3>
    <p>Household androids should be equipped with self-limiting safety mechanisms that activate fully in the event of malfunction...</p>
    
    <h2>Final Summary</h2>
    <p>The principles outlined in this document establish a robust framework for designing household androids with safety as the core priority...</p>
